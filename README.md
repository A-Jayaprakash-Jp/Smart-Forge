The "Digitization of DISA Production Records" project aims to develop a *secure, user-friendly, web-based portal* to digitize production data entry, addressing issues like data inconsistency, reporting delays, and lack of real-time tracking [SH01]. This initiative will ultimately *improve efficiency, traceability, and data integrity, enabling **better analysis of production trends and quicker decision-making* [SH01].

### Core Features of the App

The portal, designed to be *fully functional* and suitable for all roles and devices, will include the following core features:

*   *Real-time Data Entry: The app will allow **DISA machine operators or supervisors* to *immediately input production data* as it occurs [SH01]. This data will pertain to the operation of DISA's wide range of foundry technology solutions, including their various green sand moulding systems (vertical, matchplate, horizontal) [1, 2], sand preparation systems [1], and automation solutions [1]. The data could involve details about casting runs, machine parameters, and consumption of materials like *iron, steel, brass, and aluminum*, which are the types of castings produced on DISA machines [3, 4].
*   *Role-based Access Control: The portal will implement **secure login and robust data protection measures* [SH01]. This means that *operators* will have permissions primarily focused on data entry relevant to their specific machines and shifts, utilizing an *intuitive user interface (UI) designed for minimal digital skills* [SH01]. *Supervisors* will have broader access, allowing them to review, approve, and potentially modify entries, in addition to accessing reporting features. This tiered access ensures both data integrity and operational efficiency [SH01].
*   *Exporting and Backup of Records: The system will support **export functionalities* for production data, likely in formats such as CSV or Excel, to facilitate *analysis of production trends* [SH01]. Furthermore, *automated or manual data backup mechanisms* will be implemented to ensure the safety and compliance of all digitized records [SH01].
*   *Universal Device Compatibility and App-like Functionality: The portal will be **web-based* and developed using *responsive design principles* with technologies like HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript with frameworks such as React or Angular [SH01]. This ensures it works seamlessly on *standard shop-floor tablets or desktops* [SH01]. Crucially, it will support *offline data entry with sync capability* [SH01]. This means the application can function much like a native app, potentially as a *Progressive Web App (PWA), allowing it to be installed on devices and **operate even without an internet connection* [SH01]. Data entered offline will be stored locally and automatically synced to the central database once connectivity is restored [SH01].

### Data Handling by the App

Data handling within the portal will be comprehensive, ensuring integrity and accessibility:

*   *Data Origin and Input: Production data will primarily originate from DISA's extensive range of **metal casting production solutions* for the green sand foundry industry [5]. This includes data from their moulding machines (DISAMATIC®, DISA MATCH, DISA FLEX) [2], sand plants, sand mixers, conveyor systems, and cooling drums [2]. Operators and supervisors will be the direct input points for this data through the portal's *intuitive UI*, designed to make data capture straightforward and minimize errors [SH01].
*   *Backend Processing and Storage: The app's backend will be built using robust technologies such as **Node.js, Python, or Java* [SH01]. This backend will manage user authentication, data validation, and API interactions. The collected data will be securely stored in a chosen database system, which could be a *relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, or a NoSQL database like MongoDB* [SH01]. The selection will depend on the specific data structure and scalability requirements, ensuring reliable storage and retrieval of all production records [SH01].
*   *Offline Data Synchronization: A key aspect of data handling is the **offline data entry with sync capability* [SH01]. This feature allows operators to continue entering data even if network connectivity is lost on the shop floor. The data is temporarily stored on the local device and then *automatically uploaded and synchronized* with the central database once an internet connection becomes available, preventing data loss and ensuring continuous operation [SH01].
*   *Security and Protection: All data handling processes will incorporate **secure login protocols* (e.g., OAuth, JWT) and robust *data encryption* for data both in transit and at rest [SH01]. These measures are critical to protect sensitive production information and ensure data integrity, aligning with DISA's commitment to security and reliability.

### Data Visualization and Analysis

While the primary focus of the project is data entry and management, the digitized records are explicitly intended to facilitate *better analysis of production trends and quicker decision-making* [SH01].

*   *Foundation for Analysis: By digitizing previously manual records, the portal creates a **structured and consistent dataset* [SH01]. The *exporting functionality* (e.g., to CSV, Excel) will directly enable users to pull this data for external analysis [SH01]. This consistent data, gathered from various DISA machines and processes, will provide a reliable foundation for understanding operational performance, identifying bottlenecks, and optimizing production flows.
*   *Integration with DISA's Digital Ecosystem: This new data collection portal aligns perfectly with DISA's existing "Monitizer® digital solutions" [1, 2]. Monitizer, developed in partnership with Norican Digital Lab and AI partner DataProphet, is designed to **support the entire digital journey from data collection to AI-driven casting quality optimisation* [2]. It works across all types of foundries, processes, and vendor equipment to deliver *serious process improvements – fast* [2]. Therefore, the data entered into this new portal can feed into or complement the Monitizer system, enhancing its capabilities for advanced data visualization, predictive analytics, and AI-driven insights, ultimately contributing to *optimized casting quality and overall process improvements* [2]. This integration is key to leveraging the collected data beyond simple record-keeping to achieve proactive operational enhancements.
